# This is my final project of the ITD (Introduction To Digital) course from the provider [**CodeYourFuture**](https://codeyourfuture.io/)

- ## The goal of the project: to demonstrate the acquired skills in working with **HTML + CSS + JavaScript without using Frameworks**

- ## I tried to make my project visually attractive. But due to lack of time, there is no adaptive design.

- ## [**The site**](https://starishko-hometown.netlify.app/) provides basic information about my hometown.

### ***I hope this project will be interesting to you***
