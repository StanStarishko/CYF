# This is my final project of the ITD (Introduction To Digital) course from the provider [*CodeYourFuture*](https://codeyourfuture.io/)

- ## The goal of the project: to demonstrate the acquired skills in working with *HTML + CSS + JavaScript without using Frameworks*

- ## I tried to make my project *visually attractive*
     - ### What might be interesting:
       - #### Click the buttons, especially *"10 Top Facts"* and *"Your guide was"*
         - #### *"10 Top Facts"*: just move the mouse over to any item list. If you are on the phone, you could click on different items in the list.
         - #### *"Your guide was"*: try hovering the mouse over the avatar or clicking on it
  
- ## *Responsive design* implemented, adapts to the *device resolutions* 

- ## [*The site*](https://starishko-hometown.netlify.app/) provides basic information *about my hometown*

### *I hope this project will be interesting to you*
